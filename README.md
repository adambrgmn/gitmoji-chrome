# Gitmoji Chrome Extension

> A Chrome Extension for [Gitmoji](https://github.com/carloscuesta/gitmoji/)

## Usage

Gitmoji Chrome Extension is an extension that can be used to get quick acces to the emojis of Gitmoji. And to quote the original author [carloscuesta](https://github.com/carloscuesta):

> Gitmoji is an initiative to standardize and explain the use of emojis on GitHub commit messages.

Go to the [extensions page in Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions) and find Gitmoji and install it.

## Special

One thing is hidden in this package; if you're on Github, GitLab or Bitbucket and you're currently in a text input the copied emoji code will be inserted in the beginning of that input. This is very convenient if you're commiting or merging from the web version and need to add an emoji in the beginning of your message.

## Contribution

Contributions are very welcome and feel free to open an issue or submit a PR which we can discuss.

**But be aware that the emojis are fetched dynamically from [carloscuesta/gitmoji](https://github.com/carloscuesta/gitmoji). If you want more (or less) emojis, discuss that there.**
